# CS300

What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?
How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.
How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?
How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?
How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

The problem I was trying to solve in the projects in this course is how to store and retrieve data. The problems in this course helped me understand different algorithms that store data in various forms and how to retrieve said data. In order to decide what data structure to use I wrote out the pseudocode for each method and tried to calculate how fast each method would run using each method. There are vastly different runtimes between the algorithms depending on the situation. Any roadblocks I encountered I would try to reason out by myself first. If that didn't work I would try and good the issue or error in hopes that someone else has had the same issue. If the issue was unclear or I was very lost I would revisit the readings for this course.
My work on this project expanded my approach to designing software because it taught me to consider how to store and retrieve data. There are dramatically different runtimes for each and picking the right one can speed up retrieval time exponentially. Practicing writing code and seeing how the example/template code was written helped me understand how to write readable code with useful comments; Things like this really helped me pick up where I left off or allow an outsider to understand what's supposed to be happening at any given point.
